There are two files containing the main() function, namely TPCH_withResultsOutput and TPCHFullExperiment: 
* **TPCHFullExperiment:** This code includes the main experimental content as well as complete English annotations.
* **TPCH_withResultsOutput:** The function of this file is roughly similar to the former one, but it has added the function of "printing the details of inserted and deleted content". However, it should be noted that this code does not contain complete English comments, and there are also some Chinese comments.
